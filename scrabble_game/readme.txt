--Introduction--
As mentioned in "scrabble_reg.py", the structure of the program was provided by the instructor 
I was tasked with filling in the blank "problem" sections, making the program do what is intended
--Files--
scrabble_reg.py - When the user runs the program, they are starting a game of scrabble 
scrabble_comp.py - Same as scrabble_reg.py, but the user is presented with the option for a computer to play instead of themselves
    Note: computer takes a few seconds to chug through each word selection
words.txt - the wordbank used by both programs
